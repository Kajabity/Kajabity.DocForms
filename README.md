Kajabity.DocForms GitHub Repository
===================================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/a3r57ga2s2urpv0b/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Kajabity/kajabity-docforms/branch/master)

Kajabity.DocForms is a collection of WinForms classes to provide all those standard 'Boiler Plate'
file handling features of a Windows Desktop application.  These classes have been refactored 
from applications I've written over recent years and I am find I use them regularly for quickly
putting together new applications.

This repository contains several sub-projects:

-	**Kajabity.DocForms** - a DLL project providing a collection of utilities for .NET projects.
-	**Kajabity.DocForms.Test** - NUnit tests for the Kajabity.DocForms utilities.
-	**Samples** - a collection of sample Desktop application projects illustrating the use of some of Kajabity.DocForms utility classes, as well as other NuGets I have published.

See the Releases section on GitHub to download copies of code, DLL exe's and NuGets.

Kajabity.DocForms DLL is a strongly named assembly and is available from nuget.org as Kajabity.DocForms.

This code originally formed part of the Kajabity Tools library.
